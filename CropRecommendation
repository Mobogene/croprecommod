Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning
Introduction
Agriculture remains a vital component of global food security and economic stability. Efficient crop selection based on environmental and soil conditions can help farmers maximize yield, minimize resource use, and make informed decisions. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based crop recommendation system that suggests the most appropriate crop for cultivation, given specific inputs such as soil nutrients and climatic conditions. The system integrates predictive modeling with interactive interfaces for real-time user input and feedback.

Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains essential agro-environmental variables with corresponding crop labels suitable for cultivation under those conditions.

Dataset Features:

Nitrogen (N): Nitrogen level in the soil

Phosphorus (P): Phosphorus content in the soil

Potassium (K): Potassium level in the soil

Temperature: Average temperature in degrees Celsius

Humidity: Relative humidity in percentage

pH: Acidity or alkalinity level of the soil

Rainfall: Annual rainfall in millimeters

Target Variable:

Label: Recommended crop (e.g., rice, maize, cotton, etc.)

The dataset was clean and did not contain missing values, which allowed for direct preprocessing and model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis
To explore feature relationships, a correlation matrix was generated using numerical variables. The visualization indicated moderate correlations between climatic features such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity with nutrient levels, which validated the inclusion of all variables in the modeling phase.

Model Training and Evaluation
Three classification algorithms were developed and evaluated on this dataset:

1. Random Forest Classifier
A robust ensemble learning method that achieved the highest accuracy among the models tested. It effectively handled multi-class classification and outperformed other algorithms.

Accuracy: 99.3%

2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
A linear kernel SVM was employed and performed well, particularly for high-dimensional data. Its accuracy was slightly lower than the Random Forest model.

Accuracy: 97.9%

3. Logistic Regression
Used as a baseline model. Although computationally efficient, it achieved the lowest accuracy among the three.

Accuracy: 95.2%

Performance Comparison
Model	Accuracy
Random Forest	99.3%
Support Vector Machine	97.9%
Logistic Regression	95.2%

All models were trained and evaluated using an 80-20 split of the dataset. Accuracy was used as the primary metric for comparison.

Deployment and User Interface
To ensure accessibility and usability for end users, the trained Random Forest model was deployed through two interfaces:

Gradio Interface
A graphical user interface was developed using Gradio to allow users to enter input values interactively and receive real-time crop predictions. The interface captures the following inputs: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

The Gradio app also displays the most recent input values along with the corresponding predictions, allowing users to visually confirm the recommendation logic.

Streamlit Integration
In addition to Gradio, the system was also integrated with Streamlit, a web app framework for deploying machine learning models. This interface was extended to include a prediction history feature. It displays a log of previous user inputs and predicted outputs, enabling users to keep track of their queries and recommendations over time.

An example of this functionality is visible in the provided screenshot, where the interface displays:

Input: N=63, P=58, K=22, Temp=18.25Â°C, Humidity=55.28%, pH=6.20, Rainfall=63.72

Prediction: maize
This entry, along with previous predictions, is recorded and shown in real time.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of supervised machine learning models in agricultural decision support systems. The crop recommendation system, trained on real-world data, provides highly accurate predictions and is made accessible through interactive web-based interfaces. The integration of Gradio and Streamlit ensures ease of use for a wide range of users, including farmers, agronomists, and agricultural extension officers.
